# Red Hat Industrial AI Showcase

> [!NOTE]
> This project was developed with assistance from AI tools.

Working repository for an internal reference implementation of industrial-AI components on Red Hat OpenShift. Early development.

## Status

In active development. Architecture docs are living, and components land incrementally as the phased plan progresses. This is not a production deployment and not a released reference. Claims, diagrams, and component lists here reflect the current state of design rather than shipped capability.
