# GitOps topology

Argo CD reconciles every cluster from this tree. See `docs/06-repo-structure.md` for the canonical layout.

## Two-step bootstrap (once per cluster)

```
oc apply -k infrastructure/gitops/bootstrap/
# wait for operator CSV Succeeded and ArgoCD CR Available

oc apply -f infrastructure/gitops/bootstrap/root-application.yaml
```

After step 2, every change under `infrastructure/gitops/clusters/<cluster>/` is Argo CD-reconciled. The bootstrap directory itself is never reconciled by Argo CD — it's the lever that brings Argo CD into existence.

Step 2 requires the referenced `clusters/<cluster>/` path to exist on the `main` branch (Argo CD resolves `targetRevision: main`). On the first session that introduces a cluster's GitOps content, apply step 2 **after** the PR merges.

## Argo CD instance choice

This reference uses the **default `openshift-gitops` Argo CD instance** the operator creates automatically. Per Red Hat's docs, that instance exists specifically for cluster-ops work (operators, OLM, cluster config) and ships with cluster-scoped permissions and OpenShift OAuth SSO wired up. Phase 0 is 100% cluster-ops.

The `openshift-gitops` namespace hosts only Argo CD's own workloads and the `Application` / `ApplicationSet` / `AppProject` CRs that Argo CD reads. No user workloads land there; every workload gets its own namespace and an Application that reconciles into it.

A second Argo CD instance for application-tier tenant isolation can be added later if Phase 1+ workloads demand it; the first instance would manage the second via an Application.

## Directory layout

```
gitops/
├── bootstrap/              two hand-applied manifests; not reconciled
├── clusters/<name>/        per-cluster aggregation (one ApplicationSet per layer)
├── apps/<layer>/<name>/    per-application manifests (Helm, Kustomize, plain YAML)
└── overlays/{dev,demo,prod}/   Kustomize overlays for env variance
```

Sessions 03+ populate `apps/operators/*` subdirectories; the `operators` ApplicationSet picks them up automatically via its Git generator.

## Sync policy

Every Application and ApplicationSet template uses **manual sync**, no `automated:` block. OutOfSync shows in the UI; a human clicks Sync. Rationale: catch misconfigurations at review time, not at reconciliation time. Per-Application auto-sync can be opted into later as confidence builds.

Sync options applied project-wide:
- `CreateNamespace=true` — operators that install into namespaces we own get them created on first sync.
- `ServerSideApply=true` — sidesteps the 256 KiB annotation limit for large CRs (cert-manager, mesh control plane, RHOAI DSC).

## Adding a new Application

For a new operator / workload in layer `<layer>` named `<name>`:

1. Create `apps/<layer>/<name>/` with Subscription / CR / Helm / Kustomize content.
2. If the ApplicationSet for that layer doesn't exist yet, add it under `clusters/<cluster>/appsets/<layer>.yaml` and reference it from `clusters/<cluster>/kustomization.yaml`.
3. PR.
4. After merge, click Sync in the Argo CD UI (or `argocd app sync operators-<name>` from CLI).

## Cross-cluster topology

Hub (`clusters/hub/`) and companion (`clusters/companion/`) are independent today. Once ACM is installed (Phase 0 Session 05) and the companion is registered as a managed cluster (Session 13), cross-cluster Applications land via ACM's ApplicationSet delivery pattern.

Spoke clusters (`clusters/spoke-a/`, `clusters/spoke-b/`) appear in Phase 2 per `docs/04-phased-plan.md`.
